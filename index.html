            <p class="earth-text"> Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. This is enabled by Earth being a water world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water. Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's surface. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's surface is land, most of which is located in the form of continental landmasses within one hemisphere, Earth's land hemisphere. Most of Earth's land is somewhat humid and covered by vegetation, while large sheets of ice at Earth's polar deserts retain more water than Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers and atmospheric water combined. Earth's land is part of Earth's crust, consisting of several slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth has a liquid outer core that generates a magnetosphere capable of deflecting most of the destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation.</p>

            <p class="moon-text">The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It orbits at an average distance of 384400 km (238900 mi), about 30 times the planet's diameter. It always faces Earth with its near side, being tidally locked to Earth. This results in the lunar month of 29.5 days matching the lunar day. Exerting gravitational force on Earth, it and to a lesser extent the Sun are the main drivers of the tides.
              The Moon's mass is about one-sixth of Earth's; its density and surface gravity (at 0.1654 g) are rivaled among Solar System satellites only by Jupiter's moon Io. It is a satellite planet in geophysical terms and among all planetary-mass objects of the Solar System larger and more massive than all of its known dwarf planets.[17] Its diameter is 3,474 km (2,159 mi), which is roughly one-quarter that of Earth or about the width of Australia,[18] making it the largest and most massive satellite in the Solar System in relation to its parent planet and the fifth-largest Solar System satellite overall. The body of the Moon is differentiated and terrestrial, with no significant hydrosphere, atmosphere, or magnetic field. It formed 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth's formation, out of the debris from a giant impact between Earth and a hypothesized Mars-sized body called Theia.</p>
